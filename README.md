# Deloitte Machine Learning Challenge 2021
Deloitte Presents Machine Learning Challenge: Predict Loan Defaulters in association with [Machine Hack](https://machinehack.com/hackathon/deloitte_presents_machine_learning_challenge_predict_loan_defaulters/overview)
## Overview
* Banks run into losses when a customer doesn't pay their loans on time. Because of this, every year, banks have losses in crores, and this also impacts the country's economic growth to a large extent. In this hackathon, we look at various attributes such as funded amount, location, loan, balance, etc., to predict if a person will be a loan defaulter or not. 

* To solve this problem, MachineHack has created a training dataset of 67,463 rows and 35 columns and a testing dataset of 28,913 rows and 34 columns. The hackathon demands a few pre-requisite skills like big dataset, underfitting vs overfitting, and the ability to optimise “log_loss” to generalise well on unseen data.
